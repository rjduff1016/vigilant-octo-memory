        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="hello"><b>Hey there! Glad my portfolio perked your interest!</b></p>
       <p class="about">I'm an aspiring web designer in training. I am currently certified in HTML and CSS, working on JavaScript. One of my projects you are currently viewing. I've been a 911 dispatcher for 12 years, decided to venture into new career paths when I decided to start a family. Being a first responder can be quite demanding and prevent you from having a personal life.</p>
        <p class="about">That being said, I have always been interested about how websites were designed and how apps were created. Which is what brought me here. That and the persuastion of a good friend.</p>
        <p class="about">Please feel free to check out my work and contact me with any questions.</p>
        <h2><b>Hope to hear from you soon!</b></h2>
